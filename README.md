**Personal Profile**

I'm a full-stack developer recently graduate from Makers Academy. I’m interested in database management, machine learning and small quirky web apps. Programming has allowed me to explore my creativity and technical problem-solving skills which I’m eager to bring any development project focusing on creating inspired software.

Earlier this year with the drive to change career and discover more cerebral ambitions I took the leap and learnt to code, joining Makers Academy (a 12-week full-time software development boot camp) to accelerate my development skills working with like-minded individuals, growing into an ever-expanding and exciting field. I learnt the fundamentals of OOP using Ruby in Boris Bikes, front and backend development with hosting using Rails in Jjerbook and the ability to learn unfamiliar tech efficiently, showcased in our final 2-week project using JavaScript in the MERN stack: Nah-mazon: our solution for connecting local, independent businesses to customers in one single online marketplace.

* Following the TDD process, I write robust code that grows from simplicity, giving me a solid footing for any new project, language or framework, such as our first group project in Rails using Rspec and Capybara.
* Keeping code DRY means I can share readable, refactored, clear, clean code with other developers working on the project, from Node components to entier classes.  
* Adhering to Agile processes means that I am efficient and effective the rigid structure of which aided communications and relations during our first group project in JavaScript.
* I can learn Independently and stick to my schedule to grow successfully, as demonstrated throughout the Makers Bootcamp and in my projects post Bootcamp
* Experienced in Pair programming and Mobbing which involved cross-functional collaboration to get the team on the same page, helping build stronger connections and processes. This also built up my confidence.  
* Utilize effective Debugging process ‘Tighten loop & Get visibility’, which was very effective when working with new frameworks and languages especially Javascript and Node
* Studying and graduating during lockdown has instilled me with the skills and ability to be able to work successfully from a remote position, time management, discipline and has most importantly made me a more effective communicator.
