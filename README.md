**Personal Profile**

I'm a full-stack developer and recent Makers Academy graduate. I’m interested in database management, machine learning and small quirky web apps. Programming has allowed me to explore both my creativity and technical problem-solving skills which I’m eager to bring to any development project. I’m looking for a vibrant company culture where I can learn and grow my skills.    

At the start of lockdown 2020, with the drive to change career and discover more cerebral ambitions, I took the leap and learnt to code. I  joined Makers Academy (a 16-week full-time software development boot camp) which accelerated my development skills while working with like-minded individuals, excited to be growing into an ever-expanding field. I learnt the fundamentals of OOP using Ruby in Boris Bikes, front and backend development with hosting using Rails in Jjerbook. I gained the ability to tackle unfamiliar tech efficiently, as showcased in our final 2-week project Nah-Mazon, which was built using Node.js in the MERN stack.  Nah-mazon: our solution for connecting local, independent businesses to customers on a single online marketplace. Since graduating, I’ve been working on Let Me Ask My Butler, cloning the functionality of an already existing beloved web app. This has strengthened my knowledge of the front end and enhanced my full stack problem-solving skills.

<p><b>Makers Academy&nbsp;&nbsp;(May 2020 cohort)</b></p></div>

<div><p><i>The skills and processes practised at Makers include </i></p></div>

* Following the TDD process, I wrote robust code that grows from simplicity, giving me a solid footing for any new project, language or framework, such as our first group project in Rails using Rspec and Capybara.
* Keeping code DRY means I can share readable, refactored, clear, clean code with other developers working on the same project. This code could be anything from components to entire classes or models.  
* Adhering to Agile processes means that I am an efficient and effective communicator. Its rigid structure aided planning and relations during our first group project in JavaScript.
* I can learn independently and stick to my schedule in order to grow successfully, as demonstrated throughout the Makers Bootcamp and in my post Bootcamp projects.
* Experienced in Pair programming and Mobbing which involved cross-functional collaboration to get the team on the same page. This helped build stronger connections and processes and it also built up my confidence in sharing and collaborating with others.  
* I utilise the Debugging process ‘Tighten loop & Get visibility’, which is very effective when working with new frameworks and languages, especially in our final group project using Node and the React framework.
* Studying and graduating during lockdown has instilled in me the skills to work successfully from a remote position. It has also improved my time management, discipline and has most importantly made me a more effective communicator.

<p><b>Rice Up Whole Food (independent cooperative)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(07/2017 - 02/2020)</i><br></p></div>

Managing the loose wholefoods department saw me take on numerous roles and responsibilities including:

* Ordering, stocking and cleaning, being independent and collaborative, working towards a collective goal.
* Training employees in stocking, storage and allergens has shaped my leadership and communication skills.
* Memorisation of allergens reinforced my knowledge of our products and strengthened customers relations.
* I implemented more efficient procedures of topping up and ordering which lead to increased visibility of the product cycle for both employees and management.
* Meticulous record-keeping, written and digital which enhanced my accuracy and attention to detail.
* I prioritised values in line with the organisation; autonomy, solidarity and cooperation, attending all general meetings with enthusiasm.

<p><b>Teesside University BA Games Design&nbsp;&nbsp;(2.1)</b>&nbsp;<i>(2016 Graduation)</i><br></p></div>

As a technical designer, I am not only able to conceptualise but also develop projects using various tools. With skills in design, 2D/ 3D art and scripting, this gives me a well-rounded cross-disciplinary understanding of all the elements that go into a large scale project. One highlight includes being junior and technical lead of a team of around ten. The role saw me collaborating and outsourcing from various disciplines and built my resilience to pressure.

<p><b>Interests and hobbies include:</b><br></p></div>


Yoga: I started my journey about two years ago hoping to help my sore back, then coming to the realisation that yoga could offer me so much more peace of mind, connectivity and clarity in a time I really needed it most. Asana, breathwork, cold-water training and yoga nidra are now part of my daily practices. I also attend kirtan, chanting, cacao ceremonies and the occasional satsang.

Wild-swimming: What started as cold water training as part of my yoga practice has turned into one of my favorite hobbies.
Rivers, the sea in Winter or Summer, the water is a beautiful place to be especially in the stillness of the morning.

Forest camping: I feel most alive in nature, wild camping is the closest I come to living in harmony with the planet and myself.

Cooking: I thrive on hearty simple food made with love, I make the occasional decadent raw dessert. I’m also a pretty accomplished sourdough baker.

Crafts and creatively: I’ve been sewing since I was a child, making basic trousers and shorts all sorts, I’ve recently been given a sewing machine and enjoy fixing and designing my own textiles. I also enjoy digital illustration /graphic design which I hope to incorporate more into my work in the future.
